Once finished we put in the terminal:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`npm run dev\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`With this command the development environment is initialized in: 'http: // localhost: 3000 /' and we see the changes that we are implementing in our browser,\nevery time we save any of our files.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Personalization begins`}</h3>\n    <img src={imageUrl} className=\"img-centered\" alt=\"File structured in the project\" />\n    <p>{`You will see that the folder organization architecture is very intuitive.\nThe first step is to go to the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`config`}</strong>{` folder and edit the config.yml file with your project data.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In it we define the author, the metadata, the menu, and the primary colors to use in the CSS. Many of the CSS variables are defined in this\narchive. For further modifications, I explain later.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Install CLI (Command Line Interface)`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The blog, as it points out in its documentation, processes pages based on the metadata found and publishes them, extracting the information\nof the components.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You should make sure to use CLI to create all pages and new posts.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To install it, in the terminal, inside the project folder, we must do:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`npm link\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`When installing CLI we can use the keyword: `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`blog`}</strong>{` to create our posts. Following the following format:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`blog -t page -f miWeb // This command creates a new page titled: \"miWeb.js\"\nblog -t post -f blog-react -m // With this command a new post is created called: \"blog-react\"\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Why do I use a -m after the post title? Because if we do not identify the file type, by default it will be a JavaScript file.`}</p>\n    <p>{`With the -m I am specifying that it is markdown and it already automatically incorporates the header with the following metadata:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`\nimport BlogMeta from \"../../components/BlogMeta\";\n\nexport const meta = {\n    title: [\"Blog in React\"],\n    tags: [\"react\", \"next\"], \n    layout: \"post\",\n    publishDate: \"2020-04-11\",\n    modifiedDate: false, // \"You must use the American format for the dates: 'YYYY-MM-DD\"\n    seoDescription: [\"Learn how to do a blog with React and Next to serve static content\"],\n    exclude: false,\n    hideProgressBar: false,\n}\n\n<BlogMeta data={props} />\n\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`And this is the only thing you need to have your post ready. He automatically creates the URL using the file name,\nAnd as you can see, in the meta section we control whether we want to exclude it (or include it) in the blog listing.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You control the date, the tags, the title, the meta description. This with a large asterisk since I have had certain\ncomplications with the SEO part (quite an irony). I'll tell you later.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Below we simply write our post.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the official documentation you have more examples that we can use with the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`blog`}</strong>{` command, but I wanted to reflect what I think is more basic:\ncreate a post, and create a page.`}</p>\n    <p>{`NOTE: Punctually I had failures and the test post I was doing did not appear. In the documentation they point to do: 'npm run clean'.\nAlso, occasional failures, as in almost everything in life, with stopping the development environment (Ctrl +,) and starting again:\n'npm run dev' was enough.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`CSS`}</h3>\n    <p>{`As we saw at the beginning in the file 'config.yml' we define general CSS variables as the theme colors.`}</p>\n    <p>{`But if we want to modify the rest of the styles, we must go to the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`styles`}</strong>{` folder and modify the file: 'index.js'.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For example, I changed the font that came by default for headings and text.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To do this, I downloaded the font from Google Fonts and converted it to the format: .woff2 to ensure the smallest possible font size: Vollkorn and Open Sans.\nYou save them in the folder: '/public/static/fonts/'.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then in the CSS you just have to call it regularly with: @font-face.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then in the style's index.js, we can modify the CSS. Remember this is a JavaScript file, that means all CSS\nit is encapsulated within the constant: globalStyles = css.global.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Do not forget that we can use variables from the config file to bring for example the colors: '$ {config.css.accentColor};'`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Pages and components`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The difference between posts and pages is that the pages are stored in the 'pages/' folder.\nThe posts in the directory: 'pages/blog/'.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We should also not put React components in the pages directory, since Next.JS creates a path for each of these components,\nwaiting for them to be a whole page. If we only have one component, we must save it in 'pages/components/'`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's remember: The post files are markdown, and all thanks `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx\"\n      }}>{`MDX`}</a>{`, like the home page that you can find at: 'index.mdx'\nin the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`pages`}</strong>{` folder.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Furthermore, the pages are (complete) components of React. The default template has a test one titled: 'About' that I removed from this blog.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's use the code from this example template, but put it in image using the Visual Studio extension: `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode\"\n      }}>{`Polacode`}</a>{`\nI think it's cool ;-)`}</p>\n    <img src={codeImage} className=\"img-centered\" alt=\"About component code in template\" />\n    <p>{`Like any React component we can \"lay out\" our content using JSX.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We update it with the 'arrow functions', and we can \"layout\" our component. We just have to add it to the config.yml where we define its path for the menu.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In my case, I wanted to leave it simple. Same for practice (later) I will create more sections.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`SEO`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The part I thought would be easier on the blog became a headache. Everything seems easier in the documentation,\nbut I had a lot of problems because the metadata was not being sent correctly, as I explained at the beginning,\nwhen 'export const meta' is automatically created with all the data.`}</p>\n    <p>{`SEO in this starter template is managed with an NPM package: `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-seo\"\n      }}>{`Next SEO`}</a>{`. Which is wonderful.\nGreatly simplifies SEO management in projects with Next.js`}</p>\n    <p>{`It already comes in the template dependencies, or you can install it:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`npm i next-seo\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`As you can see in its documentation, it is very simple, we only have to do the import in the post or page that we want to use:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`import React from 'react';\nimport { NextSeo } from 'next-seo';\n \nexport default () => (\n  <>\n    <NextSeo\n      title=\"Simple Usage Example\"\n      description=\"A short description goes here.\"\n      canonical=\"https://www.canonical.ie/\"\n    />\n    <p>Simple Usage</p>\n  </>\n);\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`And within the NextSEO component we define the metadata and we can add Open Graph data, we can define that a page is not indexed,\nwe can add structured data etc.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's great. According to the template documentation, the metadata is passed just by modifying the data when creating the posts,\nbut I was not able to send it correctly. So I had to use the direct method of the next-seo module, as I am explaining to you.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If later I manage to resolve this point, I will do the update in the post.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are more aspects that I want to develop in this regard, for example:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The robots.txt file`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The sitemap.xml`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`But they are aspects that with practice I will be implementing, first in this blog, and later in the other parallel projects that I want to develop in these\ntechnologies.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Final thoughts`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Well this is how we started.
