This with a large asterisk since I have had certain\ncomplications with the SEO part (quite an irony). I'll tell you later.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Below we simply write our post.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the official documentation you have more examples that we can use with the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`blog`}</strong>{` command, but I wanted to reflect what I think is more basic:\ncreate a post, and create a page.`}</p>\n    <p>{`NOTE: Punctually I had failures and the test post I was doing did not appear. In the documentation they point to do: 'npm run clean'.\nAlso, occasional failures, as in almost everything in life, with stopping the development environment (Ctrl +,) and starting again:\n'npm run dev' was enough.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`CSS`}</h3>\n    <p>{`As we saw at the beginning in the file 'config.yml' we define general CSS variables as the theme colors.`}</p>\n    <p>{`But if we want to modify the rest of the styles, we must go to the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`styles`}</strong>{` folder and modify the file: 'index.js'.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For example, I changed the font that came by default for headings and text.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To do this, I downloaded the font from Google Fonts and converted it to the format: .woff2 to ensure the smallest possible font size: Vollkorn and Open Sans.\nYou save them in the folder: '/public/static/fonts/'.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then in the CSS you just have to call it regularly with: @font-face.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then in the style's index.js, we can modify the CSS. Remember this is a JavaScript file, that means all CSS\nit is encapsulated within the constant: globalStyles = css.global.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Do not forget that we can use variables from the config file to bring for example the colors: '$ {config.css.accentColor};'`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Pages and components`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The difference between posts and pages is that the pages are stored in the 'pages/' folder.\nThe posts in the directory: 'pages/blog/'.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We should also not put React components in the pages directory, since Next.JS creates a path for each of these components,\nwaiting for them to be a whole page. If we only have one component, we must save it in 'pages/components/'`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's remember: The post files are markdown, and all thanks `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx\"\n      }}>{`MDX`}</a>{`, like the home page that you can find at: 'index.mdx'\nin the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`pages`}</strong>{` folder.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Furthermore, the pages are (complete) components of React. The default template has a test one titled: 'About' that I removed from this blog.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's use the code from this example template, but put it in image using the Visual Studio extension: `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode\"\n      }}>{`Polacode`}</a>{`\nI think it's cool ;-)`}</p>\n    <img src={codeImage} className=\"img-centered\" alt=\"About component code in template\" />\n    <p>{`Like any React component we can \"layout\" our content using JSX.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We update it with the 'arrow functions', and we can \"layout\" our component. We just have to add it to the config.yml where we define its path for the menu.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In my case, I wanted to leave it simple. Same for practice (later) I will create more sections.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`SEO`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The part I thought would be easier on the blog became a headache. Everything seems easier in the documentation,\nbut I had a lot of problems because the metadata was not being sent correctly, as I explained at the beginning,\nwhen 'export const meta' is automatically created with all the data.`}</p>\n    <p>{`SEO in this starter template is managed with an NPM package: `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-seo\"\n      }}>{`Next SEO`}</a>{`. Which is wonderful.\nGreatly simplifies SEO management in projects with Next.js`}</p>\n    <p>{`It already comes in the template dependencies, or you can install it:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`npm i next-seo\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`As you can see in its documentation, it is very simple, we only have to do the import in the post or page that we want to use:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`import React from 'react';\nimport { NextSeo } from 'next-seo';\n \nexport default () => (\n  <>\n    <NextSeo\n      title=\"Simple Usage Example\"\n      description=\"A short description goes here.\"\n      canonical=\"https://www.canonical.ie/\"\n    />\n    <p>Simple Usage</p>\n  </>\n);\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`And within the NextSEO component we define the metadata and we can add Open Graph data, we can define that a page is not indexed,\nwe can add structured data etc.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It's great. According to the template documentation, the metadata is passed just by modifying the data when creating the posts,\nbut I was not able to send it correctly. So I had to use the direct method of the next-seo module, as I am explaining to you.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If later I manage to resolve this point, I will do the update in the post.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are more aspects that I want to develop in this regard, for example:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The robots.txt file`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The sitemap.xml`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`But they are aspects that with practice I will be implementing, first in this blog, and later in the other parallel projects that I want to develop in these\ntechnologies.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Final thoughts`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Well this is how we started. Creating and breaking to learn in this fantastic world of JavaScript programming.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Long life and prosperity! `}</p>\n    <p>{`See you in future reactive posts.`}</p>\n
