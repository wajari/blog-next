## I have 404 errors on my blog, but 

I was excited to launch my blog on next.js, I managed to solve almost the whole process and I was stuck in nonsense for too long.

I was reading on forums and in the documentation and other people had 404 failures when refreshing the page, but it only happens in development environment, 
not local.

These two issues described well what was happening to me:

- [404 errors with dynamic routes](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/issues/3294)
- [Refresh page & 404 bug](https://github.com/vercel/next-site/issues/192)

Thanks to [Anxo](https://es.linkedin.com/in/mancontr/es-es), my React teacher, He detected the bug. It's as simple as I didn't put the cleanUrls parameter 
in the now.json file:

~~~
"cleanUrls": true
~~~

Unbelievable! 

I hope it helps you if the same happens to you.
