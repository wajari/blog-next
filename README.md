# Intro

This proyect is mi personal developer blog. 

It is a blog created thanks to React, Next.JS and markdown.

As I explain in my [First Post](https://wajari.dev/blog/blog-react) I have made it possible thanks to **Loren Stewart**. 

He proposes that you can make your own blog with clone his repo: 

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> 

You have all the details in their [GitHub Next JS Blog kit](https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit) and this "starter theme" 
on the web [React Template](https://react-template.com/blog/next-js-markdown-blog).

I have customized it, implemented some more packages and it will be my test and experimentation field to learn React and in general programming in **JavaScript**.

In the posts that you can see in [wajari.dev](https://wajari.dev) I will discuss React, SEO, Linux, among many other topics.

Thank you for your visit and I hope you enjoy it, or you can take advantage of my experience to create your own blog.

Long life and prosperity!
